                About Me
            </h1>
            <p>I'm a Junior at Clark University double majoring in <span class="purple-text">Computer Science</span> and <span class="purple-text">Interactive Media</span> in the Game Development and Programming track. In my free time, I enjoy playing both board and video games, writing music on the piano or digitally, and doing logic puzzles.</p>
            <p>Before studying at Clark, I started my college journey at Bard College at Simon's Rock when I was 16. There I took my first college-level computer science course, as well as a cryptography course, and discovered my passion for the field.</p>
            <p>Since then, I have explored different facets of computer science, combining it with my love of games to work as lead programmer on game development teams, and delving deeper into asymmetrical cryptography through a semester-long project for my Algorithms course at Clark.</p>
            <p>I expect to graduate with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Arts in Interactive Media in December of 2026.</p>
